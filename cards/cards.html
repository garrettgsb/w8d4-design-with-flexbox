        <p>Turtles are diapsids of the order Testudines (or Chelonii characterized by a special bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs and acting as a shield. "Turtle" may refer to the order as a whole (American English) or to fresh-water and sea-dwelling testudines (British English). The order Testudines includes both extant (living) and extinct species. The earliest known members of this group date from 220 million years ago, making turtles one of the oldest reptile groups and a more ancient group than snakes or crocodilians. Of the 356 known species alive today, some are highly endangered.</p>

        <p>The hot dog or dog (also spelled hotdog) is a grilled or steamed link-sausage sandwich where the sausage is served in the slit of a partially sliced hot dog bun, a bun of size and shape to hold the sausage. It can also refer to the sausage (the wurst or w√∂rst) of its composition itself. The sausage used is the wiener (Vienna sausage) or frankfurter (also frank). The names of these sausages also commonly refer to their assembled sandwiches. Typical condiments include mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise, and relish, and common garnishes include onions, sauerkraut, chili, cheese, coleslaw, and olives. Hot dog variants include the corn dog and pigs in a blanket. The hot dog's cultural traditions include the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest and the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile.</p>

          A monocle is a type of corrective lens used to correct or enhance the vision in only one eye. It consists of a circular lens, generally with a wire ring around the circumference that can be attached to a string or wire. The other end of the string is then connected to the wearer's clothing to avoid losing the monocle. The antiquarian Philipp von Stosch wore a monocle in Rome in the 1720s, in order to closely examine engravings and antique engraved gems, but the monocle did not become an article of gentlemen's apparel until the nineteenth century. It was introduced by the dandy's quizzing glass of the 1790s, as a sense of high fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are three styles of monocle. The first style consists of a simple loop of metal with a lens which was slotted into the eye orbit. These were the first monocles worn in England and could be found from the 1830s onwards. The second style, which was developed in the 1890s, was the most elaborate, consisting of a frame with a raised edge-like extension known as the gallery. The gallery was designed to help secure the monocle in place by raising it out of the eye's orbit slightly, so that the eyelashes would not jar it. Monocles with galleries were often the most expensive. The very wealthy would have the frames custom-made to fit their eye sockets. A sub-category of the galleried monocle was the "sprung gallery", where the gallery was replaced by an incomplete circle of flattened, ridged wire supported by three posts. The ends were pulled together, the monocle was placed in the eye orbit, and the ends released, causing the gallery to spring out and keep the monocle in place. The third style of monocle was frameless. This consisted of a cut piece of glass, with a serrated edge to provide a grip and sometimes a hole drilled into one side for a cord. Often the frameless monocle had no cord and would be worn freely. This style was popular at the beginning of the 20th century as the lens could be cut to fit any shape eye orbit inexpensively, without the cost of a customized frame.

        <p>A snowman is an anthropomorphic snow sculpture often built by children in regions with sufficient snowfall. In many places, typical snowmen consist of three large snowballs of different sizes with some additional accoutrements for facial and other features. Due to the sculptability of snow, there is also a wide variety of other styles. Common accessories include branches for arms and a rudimentary smiley face, with a carrot used for a nose. Clothing, such as a hat or scarf, may be included. Low-cost and availability are the common issues, since snowmen are usually abandoned to the elements once completed.</p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole
    </h2>
    <p>
      Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
      bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
      book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
      it, &lsquo;and what is the use of a book,&rsquo; thought Alice &lsquo;without pictures or
      conversations?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot
      day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making
      a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the
      daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing so <i>very</i> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
      <i>very</i> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, &lsquo;Oh dear! Oh
      dear! I shall be late!&rsquo; (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred
      to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all
      seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually <i>took a watch out of
        its waistcoat-pocket</i>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started
        to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen
        a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and
        burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately
        was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
      </p>
      <p>
        In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in
        the world she was to get out again.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
        dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
        about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep
        well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty
        of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to
        happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was
        coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the
        sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and
        book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She
        took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled
        &lsquo;ORANGE MARMALADE&rsquo;, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did
        not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put
        it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; thought Alice to herself, &lsquo;after such a fall as this, I shall
        think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they&rsquo;ll all think me at
        home! Why, I wouldn&rsquo;t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of
        the house!&rsquo; (Which was very likely true.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Down, down, down. Would the fall <i>never</i> come to an end! &lsquo;I wonder how many
        miles I&rsquo;ve fallen by this time?&rsquo; she said aloud. &lsquo;I must be getting
        somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four
        thousand miles down, I think&mdash;&rsquo; (for, you see, Alice had learnt
        several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though
        this was not a <i>very</i> good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as
        there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it
        over) &lsquo;&mdash;yes, that&rsquo;s about the right distance&mdash;but then I wonder
        what Latitude or Longitude I&rsquo;ve got to?&rsquo; (Alice had no idea what Latitude
        was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Presently she began again. &lsquo;I wonder if I shall fall right <i>through</i> the
        earth! How funny it&rsquo;ll seem to come out among the people that walk with
        their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think&mdash;&rsquo; (she was rather
        glad there <i>was</i> no one listening, this time, as it didn&rsquo;t sound at all the
        right word) &lsquo;&mdash;but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
        country is, you know. Please, Ma&rsquo;am, is this New Zealand or Australia?&rsquo;
        (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke&mdash;fancy <i>curtseying</i> as you&rsquo;re
        falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) &lsquo;And what an
        ignorant little girl she&rsquo;ll think me for asking! No, it&rsquo;ll never do to
        ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
        talking again. &lsquo;Dinah&rsquo;ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!&rsquo;
        (Dinah was the cat.) &lsquo;I hope they&rsquo;ll remember her saucer of milk at
        tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no
        mice in the air, I&rsquo;m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that&rsquo;s very
        like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?&rsquo; And here Alice
        began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy
        sort of way, &lsquo;Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?&rsquo; and sometimes, &lsquo;Do bats
        eat cats?&rsquo; for, you see, as she couldn&rsquo;t answer either question, it didn&rsquo;t
        much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and
        had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and
        saying to her very earnestly, &lsquo;Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever
        eat a bat?&rsquo; when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of
        sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
        she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long
        passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There
        was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just
        in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, &lsquo;Oh my ears and whiskers,
        how late it&rsquo;s getting!&rsquo; She was close behind it when she turned the
        corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a
        long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
        Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
        door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get
        out again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
        glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice&rsquo;s first
        thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but,
        alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at
        any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round,
        she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was
        a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key
        in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
      </p>
      <p>
        Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much
        larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into
        the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark
        hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool
        fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; &lsquo;and
        even if my head would go through,&rsquo; thought poor Alice, &lsquo;it would be of
        very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like
        a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.&rsquo; For, you see,
        so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to
        think that very few things indeed were really impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back
        to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate
        a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she
        found a little bottle on it, (&lsquo;which certainly was not here before,&rsquo; said
        Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words
        &lsquo;DRINK ME&rsquo; beautifully printed on it in large letters.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was all very well to say &lsquo;Drink me,&rsquo; but the wise little Alice was not
        going to do <i>that</i> in a hurry. &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ll look first,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and see
        whether it&rsquo;s marked &ldquo;<i>poison</i>&rdquo; or not&rsquo;; for she had read several nice little
        histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts
        and other unpleasant things, all because they <i>would</i> not remember the
        simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker
        will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger
        <i>very</i> deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten
        that, if you drink much from a bottle marked &lsquo;poison,&rsquo; it is almost
        certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this bottle was <i>not</i> marked &lsquo;poison,&rsquo; so Alice ventured to taste
        it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of
        cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered
        toast,) she very soon finished it off.

      <p>
        &lsquo;What a curious feeling!&rsquo; said Alice; &lsquo;I must be shutting up like a
        telescope.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
        brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
        through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
        waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
        she felt a little nervous about this; &lsquo;for it might end, you know,&rsquo; said
        Alice to herself, &lsquo;in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder
        what I should be like then?&rsquo; And she tried to fancy what the flame of a
        candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember
        ever having seen such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
        into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
        door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went
        back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she
        could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to
        climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when
        she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and
        cried.
      </p>
      <p>
        &lsquo;Come, there&rsquo;s no use in crying like that!&rsquo; said Alice to herself, rather
        sharply; &lsquo;I advise you to leave off this minute!&rsquo; She generally gave
        herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and
        sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes;
        and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated
        herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this
        curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s no
        use now,&rsquo; thought poor Alice, &lsquo;to pretend to be two people! Why, there&rsquo;s
        hardly enough of me left to make <i>one</i> respectable person!&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
        she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words &lsquo;EAT
        ME&rsquo; were beautifully marked in currants. &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll eat it,&rsquo; said Alice,
        &lsquo;and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me
        grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I&rsquo;ll get into the
        garden, and I don&rsquo;t care which happens!&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, &lsquo;Which way? Which
        way?&rsquo;, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
        growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
        size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had
        got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to
        happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the
        common way.
      </p>
      <p>
        So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

          CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears
        </h2>
        <p>
          &lsquo;Curiouser and curiouser!&rsquo; cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
          for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); &lsquo;now I&rsquo;m
          opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!&rsquo;
          (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
          sight, they were getting so far off). &lsquo;Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder
          who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I&rsquo;m sure <i>I</i>
          shan&rsquo;t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself
          about you: you must manage the best way you can;&mdash;but I must be kind
          to them,&rsquo; thought Alice, &lsquo;or perhaps they won&rsquo;t walk the way I want to go!
          Let me see: I&rsquo;ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.&rsquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. &lsquo;They must go
          by the carrier,&rsquo; she thought; &lsquo;and how funny it&rsquo;ll seem, sending presents
          to one&rsquo;s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!

          Oh dear, what nonsense I&rsquo;m talking!&rsquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
          now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
          key and hurried off to the garden door.
        </p>
        <p>
          Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
          look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
          hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.
        </p>
        <p>
          &lsquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourself,&rsquo; said Alice, &lsquo;a great girl like
          you,&rsquo; (she might well say this), &lsquo;to go on crying in this way! Stop this
          moment, I tell you!&rsquo; But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of
          tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep
          and reaching half down the hall.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she
          hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit
          returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand
          and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry,
          muttering to himself as he came, &lsquo;Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won&rsquo;t
          she be savage if I&rsquo;ve kept her waiting!&rsquo; Alice felt so desperate that she
          was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she
          began, in a low, timid voice, &lsquo;If you please, sir&mdash;&rsquo; The Rabbit
          started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried
          away into the darkness as hard as he could go.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept
          fanning herself all the time she went on talking: &lsquo;Dear, dear! How queer
          everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder
          if I&rsquo;ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got
          up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.
          But if I&rsquo;m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah,
          <i>that&rsquo;s</i> the great puzzle!&rsquo; And she began thinking over all the children she
          knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been
          changed for any of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not Ada,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;for her hair goes in such long
          ringlets, and mine doesn&rsquo;t go in ringlets at all; and I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t be
          Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very
          little! Besides, <i>she&rsquo;s</i> she, and <i>I&rsquo;m</i> I, and&mdash;oh dear, how puzzling it
          all is! I&rsquo;ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four
          times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven
          is&mdash;oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the
          Multiplication Table doesn&rsquo;t signify: let&rsquo;s try Geography. London is the
          capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome&mdash;no,
          <i>that&rsquo;s</i> all wrong, I&rsquo;m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I&rsquo;ll
          try and say &ldquo;<i>How doth the little</i>&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo; and she crossed her hands on her
          lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice
          sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they
          used to do:&mdash;
        </p>
        <pre xml:space="preserve">
          &lsquo;How doth the little crocodile
          Improve his shining tail,
          And pour the waters of the Nile
          On every golden scale!

          &lsquo;How cheerfully he seems to grin,
          How neatly spread his claws,
          And welcome little fishes in
          With gently smiling jaws!&rsquo;
        </pre>
        <p>
          &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure those are not the right words,&rsquo; said poor Alice, and her eyes
          filled with tears again as she went on, &lsquo;I must be Mabel after all, and I
          shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no
          toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I&rsquo;ve made up
          my mind about it; if I&rsquo;m Mabel, I&rsquo;ll stay down here! It&rsquo;ll be no use their
          putting their heads down and saying &ldquo;Come up again, dear!&rdquo; I shall only
          look up and say &ldquo;Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like
          being that person, I&rsquo;ll come up: if not, I&rsquo;ll stay down here till I&rsquo;m
          somebody else&rdquo;&mdash;but, oh dear!&rsquo; cried Alice, with a sudden burst of
          tears, &lsquo;I do wish they <i>would</i> put their heads down! I am so <i>very</i> tired of
          being all alone here!&rsquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
          that she had put on one of the Rabbit&rsquo;s little white kid gloves while she
          was talking. &lsquo;How <i>can</i> I have done that?&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;I must be growing
          small again.&rsquo; She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it,
          and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet
          high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the
          cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily,
          just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
          &lsquo;That <i>was</i> a narrow escape!&rsquo; said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
          sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; &lsquo;and now
          for the garden!&rsquo; and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but,
          alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying
          on the glass table as before, &lsquo;and things are worse than ever,&rsquo; thought
          the poor child, &lsquo;for I never was so small as this before, never! And I
          declare it&rsquo;s too bad, that it is!&rsquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!
          she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had
          somehow fallen into the sea, &lsquo;and in that case I can go back by railway,&rsquo;
          she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and
          had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English
          coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children
          digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and
          behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in
          the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.
        </p>
        <p>
          &lsquo;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t cried so much!&rsquo; said Alice, as she swam about, trying to
          find her way out. &lsquo;I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being
          drowned in my own tears! That <i>will</i> be a queer thing, to be sure! However,
          everything is queer to-day.&rsquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
          off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it
          must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she
          was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped
          in like herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          &lsquo;Would it be of any use, now,&rsquo; thought Alice, &lsquo;to speak to this mouse?
          Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely
          it can talk: at any rate, there&rsquo;s no harm in trying.&rsquo; So she began: &lsquo;O
          Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming
          about here, O Mouse!&rsquo; (Alice thought this must be the right way of
          speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she
          remembered having seen in her brother&rsquo;s Latin Grammar, &lsquo;A mouse&mdash;of a
          mouse&mdash;to a mouse&mdash;a mouse&mdash;O mouse!&rsquo;) The Mouse looked at
          her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little
          eyes, but it said nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          &lsquo;Perhaps it doesn&rsquo;t understand English,&rsquo; thought Alice; &lsquo;I daresay it&rsquo;s a
          French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.&rsquo; (For, with all her
          knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything
          had happened.) So she began again: &lsquo;Ou est ma chatte?&rsquo; which was the first
          sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of
          the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. &lsquo;Oh, I beg your
          pardon!&rsquo; cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal&rsquo;s
          feelings. &lsquo;I quite forgot you didn&rsquo;t like cats.&rsquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &lsquo;Not like cats!&rsquo; cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. &lsquo;Would
          <i>you</i> like cats if you were me?&rsquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &lsquo;Well, perhaps not,&rsquo; said Alice in a soothing tone: &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be angry about
          it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you&rsquo;d take a
          fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,&rsquo;
          Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, &lsquo;and
          she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her
          face&mdash;and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse&mdash;and she&rsquo;s such
          a capital one for catching mice&mdash;oh, I beg your pardon!&rsquo; cried Alice
          again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt
          certain it must be really offended. &lsquo;We won&rsquo;t talk about her any more if
          you&rsquo;d rather not.&rsquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &lsquo;We indeed!&rsquo; cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
          tail. &lsquo;As if <i>I</i> would talk on such a subject! Our family always <i>hated</i> cats:
          nasty, low, vulgar things! Don&rsquo;t let me hear the name again!&rsquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t indeed!&rsquo; said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
          conversation. &lsquo;Are you&mdash;are you fond&mdash;of&mdash;of dogs?&rsquo; The
          Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: &lsquo;There is such a nice
          little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed
          terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it&rsquo;ll fetch
          things when you throw them, and it&rsquo;ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and
          all sorts of things&mdash;I can&rsquo;t remember half of them&mdash;and it
          belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it&rsquo;s so useful, it&rsquo;s worth a
          hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and&mdash;oh dear!&rsquo; cried
          Alice in a sorrowful tone, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve offended it again!&rsquo; For the
          Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite
          a commotion in the pool as it went.
        </p>
        <p>
          So she called softly after it, &lsquo;Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
          won&rsquo;t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don&rsquo;t like them!&rsquo; When the
          Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face
          was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
          trembling voice, &lsquo;Let us get to the shore, and then I&rsquo;ll tell you my
          history, and you&rsquo;ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.&rsquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
          birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a
          Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the
          way, and the whole party swam to the shore.
